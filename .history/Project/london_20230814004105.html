      Overview ▼
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p class="text">Life in London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers find that one visit isn't enough to experience everything this two-millennia-old city has to offer. Here, the antiquated clasps hands with the contemporary. You'll find the historic Tower of London and the avant-garde Tate Modern. You can catch both the Bard's works and modern plays at Shakespeare's Globe and its accompanying Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. And while Londoners still praise the power of tea, they now make room for Starbucks and Costa Coffees here and there, and pressed juice too. A current leader in everything from politics and banking to fashion and music, London's culture compass is always attuned to what's next. Discover it all on one of London's best tours. One thing to keep in mind it's nearly impossible to escape crowds in London. Along with being one of the biggest cities in Europe, London is one of the most popular destinations to visit in the world, so no matter what time of year you go, you're bound to run into lots of tourists. A valid passport is required for U.S. citizens entering the United Kingdom. No tourist visas are required for visits less than six months. If you're planning to travel to other continental European countries, it is recommended that you have six months remaining validity on your passport. For more information, visit the U.S. State Department's website.</p><br>
      
      <h2>Best Months to Visit London</h2><br>
      
      <p class="text">The best time to visit London is March through May when the temperatures are mild and the city's parks are green and blooming. However, late spring – along with summer – is also prime tourist season, and hotel and flight prices reflect the surge. You're more likely to find airfare and accommodation deals in the fall and winter though you'll also encounter chilly temperatures. December in London is also an incredibly popular place to be during the holidays, so expect the streets to be crowded with both English and international tourists. And no matter when you travel, you should pack an umbrella: London is notorious for experiencing misty days and showers year-round. If you have any concerns related to the weather, crowds or other unpredictable factors, you might want to consider an international travel insurance policy or a cancel for any reason plan for more extensive coverage.</p>

      <img class="side" src="image/lontemp.jpg" alt=" London weather "/><br>
      
      <h2 class="culture">Culture & Customs</h2><br>
      
      <p class="text">Aside from a few select phrases and words, Americans find the city accessible because of London's official English language. British people are very polite and quite friendly to tourists, so don't be afraid to ask for directions if you're lost. More often than not Londoners are happy to point you in the right direction, or even offer a recommendation about their city. But keep in mind that the British like order. There is no better example than how you are expected to behave on the Tube (London's subway). Make sure to stand to the right when going up or down escalators. The other side to the Brits, especially among the young adults, is their penchant for drinking. Unlike coffee shops in the U.S., pubs are the prime watering hole for the Brits. Most pubs serve meals and are open the majority of the day, so don't be alarmed if you see people walking in with young children. Once 5 o'clock rolls around, the hunger for a post-work pick me up is rampant in London, and pubs, as well as bars, tend to fill up throughout the week. Expect to see hordes of people congregating outside pubs in the warmer months and some stumbling out nightly at around 9 p.m. Also, since London is one of the fashion capitals of the world, you'll see locals dressed to the nines throughout the city but especially around Oxford Street, where many fashion houses and publications are located. If you ever wanted to go the extra mile with your style game, London is the place to do it.London's official currency is the British pound. Since the pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. As for tipping, some restaurants and cafes may add a service charge to the bill, upward of 12%. If a service charge is not allotted, it's customary to tip between 10 and 15%, especially if you're in a restaurant. If you're drinking at a pub or wine bar, tipping is discretionary. And in a cab, tip the driver to the nearest pound or about 10% of the cost. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops.</p><br>
      
      <h2>Safety Procedures</h2><br>
      
      <p class="text">London is generally a very safe city; however, travelers should take note of several safety tips. The U.S. State Department advises tourists to only use London's licensed black cabs. Unlicensed cab companies and private cars posing as taxis have been known to rip off, mug, or even sexually assault customers. To be safe, travelers should call the taxi company and hire a car directly (hotels can help arrange transportation as well). Travelers should also be wary of pickpockets, who tend to target tourists on the Tube or at popular attractions. The U.S. State Department also strongly advises visitors not to leave drinks unattended in bars and nightclubs, as there have been reports of robbery and rape after drinks have been spiked with illegal substances. For more information, visit the state department's <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(53, 1, 1);" href='https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/UnitedKingdom.html'>website.</a> In recent years, London has also been the target of several terrorist attacks, five of which occurred in 2017 alone. According to the U.S. Department of State, terrorist groups continue to plot attacks, so increased vigilance is required. Travelers should stay aware of their surroundings, consider enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive security messages and follow local media to stay informed.  </p>

          <h3>The Savoy is a five-star experience known worldwide for its luxurious and beautiful accommodations. As the first hotel built for the purpose of being a luxe hotel in all of London, it has a rich and storied history. Of all the hotels in London, this is one of the most iconic. The rumored favorite hotel of Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich (who has a suite named after her), the Savoy was the first hotel in Britain to have elevators and electric light, and it is still at the top of its game. There’s a guaranteed shiver of excitement as you step past the top hats and tails of the doormen and back in time onto the checkered floor of the grand, wood-paneled lobby. Seeing its beautiful architecture and dramatic decor is worth doing even if you don't end up staying here.</h3>

        <h3>Four Seasons Hotel London At Park Lane is a beautiful property in a modern building. The foyer of the Four Seasons London is decadently attired in black marble and warm burgundy reds.

Your every need is catered for. The decor in the rooms is traditional and classy, with a plush feel. Objet d’art is scattered throughout, with black and white prints of stars from the past hanging from the walls. The decor is a mix of warm golds, browns, and deep reds. The bathrooms are black shiny marble, and luxurious. Even the plush corridors are worth a mention. Adorned with photos of glamorous stars in the vain of Marylin Munroe, they feel safe and luxurious (you need to use your room key to get the lift to take you up to the corridors and rooms). In fact, even though this isn’t a small hotel, the Four Seasons London has the feel of a large boutique hotel with just the right number of rooms and with that “just right” lighting level everywhere – you look fabulous but can still see!

            <img class="place" src="image/museum.jpg" alt="museum"/>

            <h3>The British Museum is both an architectural beauty and a trove of some of the world's most noted antiquities. In fact, many travelers say it's the best museum in all of London. What's more, it's free to visit. From the Rosetta Stone to the Parthenon Sculptures to Mesopotamian objects, the British Museum is a history buff's dream containing artifacts in the millions. The immense collection can make an initial museum visit seem overwhelming: Pick the exhibits that most interest you, and plan return trips if you feel so inclined. The museum opens daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and closes at 8:30 p.m. on Fridays. Though admission is free, access to some exhibitions will cost you. While walk-up entry is available, the museum recommends booking tickets online in advance. You'll find a gift shop and four eateries on-site, including two quick-service cafes and casual pizzeria, as well as the more formal Great Court Restaurant. In addition, food trucks serve those opting to eat outside. The British Museum is accessible from the Tottenham Court Road, Holborn, Goodge Street and Russell Square Tube stops. More than a dozen bus routes also stop near the museum. For more information, visit the British Museum's website.</h3>

            <img class="place" src="image/tower.jpg" alt="tour"/>

          <h3>Although its exterior might be grim and even unimpressive (especially when compared to stately Buckingham Palace), the Tower of London's interior is always bustling with activity. Despite its name, the large complex has a long history as a palace, a fortress and a prison. Each exhibition and activity here explores this history. If you're enchanted with the monarchy, don't miss the famous crown jewels exhibition. Among the items you'll see is the Imperial State Crown – which is still worn by the queen for each State Opening of Parliament – and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. In 2020, Prince of Wales' Investiture Coronet joined the display in the Jewel House. For an oral history, take an entertaining tour led by the Yeoman Warders (tower guards). The Tower of London, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is typically open daily year-round, but specific operating hours vary depending on season. Tickets for adults cost 33.60 pounds (about $36); entrance for children age 5 to 15 costs 16.80 pounds (about $18). Children younger than 5 get in for free. Visitors are encouraged to book their tickets in advance through the Tower of London's website. If you have a London Pass, your entry is covered. Along with bathroom facilities, the Tower of London also offers multiple eateries and several gift shops on-site. You'll find the Tower of London off the Tower Hill Tube stop. Bus routes 15, 42, 78, 100 and RV1 also stop close to the Tower, which has bicycle racks.</h3>

          <img class="place" src="image/buckingham.jpg" alt="Shangri-La Hotels"/>

        <h3>Buckingham Palace, King Charles III's London home, is open for touring (except for the king's private quarters, of course) from July to October. On the tour, you'll have access to the 19 State Rooms where the king and members of the royal family host guests for state, ceremonial and official affairs. Opulently accented with chandeliers, candelabras, paintings by Van Dyck and Canaletto, and exquisite English and French furniture, these rooms display some of the most magnificent pieces from the Royal Collection.Travelers are welcome to tour the palace during the summer months, when it is open to the public. For the rest of the year, private, guided tours may be available. Visit the palace's website for up-to-date openings and tour times. Ticket prices vary, but you can expect to pay about 30 pounds (about $36) per adult and 16.50 pounds (around $20) per child ages 5 to 17 if you book online before you go. If you're only hoping to quickly pass by this English institution, consider signing up for one of London's best tours – several make stops outside of the palace. If you'd rather skip the admission fees altogether, you can still experience Buckingham Palace by witnessing the storied Changing of the Guard (also referred to as Guard Mounting), which occurs at 11 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesday, Fridays and Sundays most of the year and daily during summer (except during inclement weather). Make sure to get there early, as many previous visitors say the area gets crowded very quickly, making it hard to see anything if you arrive shortly before the ceremony starts. You'll find Buckingham Palace off the Green Park, Hyde Park Corner and St. James's Park Tube stops. Bus Nos. 11, 211, C1 and C10 stop nearby.</h3>

    <li class="lists"><strong>Houses of Parliament</strong></li>
    <img class="place" src="image/parli.jpg" alt="tour 4"/>
    
    <h3 class="address">Step through halls where history was made time and again by visiting the British Parliament. Guided and self-guided tours (which come highly recommended by recent travelers) take visitors through multiple areas of the building, including Westminster Hall (the oldest building on the Parliamentary estate, which is more than 900 years old), the House of Commons Chamber and the House of Lords. If you're not interested in perusing the corridors that make up the U.K.'s governing body, many travelers say that simply admiring the iconic structure's impressive exterior is enough, and an absolute must-do for anyone visiting London. Guided and self-guided tours are all available most Saturdays year-round as well as most weekdays during Parliamentary recess. Self-guided tours, which include an audio guide (available in multiple languages), take about 90 minutes and are 25 pounds (about $30) for adults and one child can tour for free with each full-price adult. Otherwise, tickets for a child cost 8 pounds (around $10) for each child aged 5 to 15 years. Guided tours (in English only) cost 32 pounds (around $38) for adults and 16 pounds (about $19) for children ages 5 to 15 years. All children younger than 5 enter for free, but do require a ticket. Consult Parliament's website for up-to-date information on tour dates and hours, as they are subject to change. To get to the Houses of Parliament, hop off at the Westminster Tube station from the Circle, District or Jubilee Underground Lines. Several bus lines stop across the street as well.</h3>

  <img class="place" src="image/bridge.jpg" alt="tour 5"/>
  
  <h3>Along with Parliament and Big Ben, Tower Bridge is London's next must-see architectural marvel, not to mention the most famous bridge that crosses the Thames. Construction on the bridge started in 1886, which means it's practically modern by London standards, but Tower Bridge stands out for its stunning detail and moveable roadways that lift up when large ships need to pass through. The views from the bridge are an added bonus. From the elevated sidewalks visitors get a prime view of the Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral's iconic dome, the London Eye and The Monument. If you're interested in viewing the city from a higher vantage point (about 137 feet above the Thames), consider a visit inside Tower Bridge, during which you go to the top of the bridge – equipped with a glass floor – as well as to the bottom to the engine rooms. For self-guided visits, adults pay 12.30 pounds (about $15.50), youths ages 5 to 15 pay 6.30 pounds (about $7.80), while children younger than 5 get in for free. If you have a London Pass, entry to the bridge is included. Guided tours are available on weekends and start at 27 pounds (or about $34). The bridge is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. (with the last entry at 5 p.m.). Keep in mind that a walk across the bridge is free and nearly as impressive. Hop off the Tube at Tower Hill to stroll across. You can also take bus routes nos. 15, 42, 78, 100 and 343. Bike racks and Santander Cycle docking stations are located nearby. For more information, visit the Tower Bridge's website.

      <h3>Dilara is a low-key looking joint on Finsbury Park’s Blackstock Road that serves huge, incredible helpings of Uyghur cuisine, a blend of northern Chinese dishes like noodles and dumplings, kebabs and meat-soaked bread. It’s one of the few places in London where you can find overlooked, but certainly not under-flavoured Uyghur food (Etles in Walthamstow is another). Come for a powerful Szechuan punch and some of the finest noodles in London. Most common dishes people order are large-plate chicken, with its hand-pulled noodles and dry chill spice, tugure dumplings, samsa pastries and smashed cucumber on the side. </h3>

Massive portions with a side order of massive fun. What’s not to like? It’s cheaper than booking a flight to Thailand by way of California, and because it’s in a hotel, it’s open all day for indulgent brekkies and lunches, too. Most popular dish: The gloriously gloopy blue-cheese-slathered wedge salad, complete with candied pork jowl and garlic nam jim dipping sauce.

  <h3>The menu itself is befitting of such a grand Victorian building. Rather than match the art with aggressively modern cuisine, the food here is traditional British fare with a touch of contemporary grace. This Mayfair newbie opened at the end of 2022 and, thanks to owners Hauser & Wirth, contains £50m-worth of masterpieces by everyone from Lucian Freud to Pablo Picasso. The food – trad British which borders on the Victorian but comes with a graceful twist – is pretty special too. Most popular dish: The showstopping lobster-head pie has got everyone talking, and at £96 you’d hope it would. But it’s possible to plump for something a little more pocket-friendly, including a selection of classic savouries, such as London rarebit, Gentleman’s Relish and cucumber on toast, or devilled-kidney omelette at £12 each.</h3>

  <li class="lists"><strong>Quo Vadis</strong></li>
  <img class="place" src="image/food4.jpg" alt="food 4"/>
  
  <h3>Old Soho looms large at Quo Vadis. This elegantly bohemian members’ club heaves with history, despite the fact that its public dining room received a thorough makeover at the start of 2023. The recently revamped classic dining room of the ‘great dame of Dean Street’ boasts one of the world’s most charismatic chefs at the fore. Jeremy Lee has made a menu to treasure: seasonal, sensational and never one to scrimp on pudding, which regularly comes slathered in custard. Most popular dish: Pies are Lee’s passion. Order whatever filling is going and a smoked eel sarnie on the side.</h3>

<li class="lists"><strong>Tofu Vegan</strong></li>
<img class="place" src="image/food5.jpg" alt="food 5"/>

<h3>The menu is entirely plant-based: it’s mock-meat, tofu and beancurd galore. But the fact it’s all vegan (and by extension, theoretically less damaging to the environment) isn’t the best part. The best part is that it’s genuinely delicious Chinese cuisine. It’s a wild bombshell of spicy, sweet, sour, and savoury – the kind of food that will shock your tastebuds and test your tongue with unusual textures. It’s not the watered-down chips-and-curry-sauce kind. It’s food that diehard carnivores literally couldn’t complain about and food that vegans will go apeshit for. Most popular dish: The shredded tofu and water chestnut wontons in house special sauce. Deep, garlicky, fiery and fizzy, it’s an oily concoction of pure, merciful pleasure.</h3>

  <div class="description">
    <p class="text">The best way to get around London is the rapid-transit London Underground, or what locals call "the Tube." You can even take the Tube from <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(53, 1, 1);" href='https://www.heathrow.com/'>Heathrow Airport</a> (LHR) – one of the world's busiest airports – into the city center. This widespread and efficient system stretches throughout London and beyond, and it is relatively easy to navigate. Buying an Oyster card will further simplify your travel since it can be used on the Underground system, as well as on city buses and other forms of transportation. Visitors should also bring a comfortable pair of walking shoes since meandering is the most atmospheric way to traverse the city. If you need a little guidance on where to wander, consult a local by taking one of <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(53, 1, 1);" href='https://travel.usnews.com/features/the-best-london-tours'>London's top tours.</a></p><br>
          
    <h2>Bicycle</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">London's bike-sharing operation, Santander Cycle, facilitates unlimited trips of up to 30 minutes within a 24-hour period for just 2 pounds (about $2.75). (Trips longer than half an hour result in charges of 2 pounds per each 30-minute interval.) The system has 11,500 bikes and more than 750 docking stations around London. You can hire a bike with a credit card at a docking station or using the app available from Transport for London.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Bus</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">The allure to traveling by bus is that you get to see the sights. The London Underground is, well, underground, so you miss out on the city's scenic views. Fares start at 1.55 pounds (about $2.15) for a single ride with an Oyster. Keep in mind that buses don't take cash, so it's best to have a topped-up Oyster card to pay for your trip. Many bus routes cover the entire city and run 24 hours a day. According to the London visitor's bureau, routes Nos. 9, 14, 15 and 22 are particularly good for sightseeing.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Car</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Think twice before "hiring" or renting a car in London. For Americans used to driving on the right side of the road, keep in mind that Londoners drive on the left. The cars are also usually manual; automatics tend to cost more. In addition, traffic and parking are awful, and the cost of petrol (or gas) is high. That said, you can hire cars at the airports or at many locations throughout central London. Keep in mind that using hand-held cell phones while driving is illegal; the speed limit on highways is 70 mph.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Taxi</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">London's famous black cabs can be found throughout the city, as well as in designated lines at busy train stations, airports and hotels. When you're hailing one on the street, keep in mind that a lit-up taxi sign means it's available. Cabs are metered, and fares vary by time of day and distance. There's always a minimum fee of 3.20 pounds (about $4.40), but a journey of a mile or more will cost at least 6.20 pounds (about $8.50). You can pay with cash – or quid, as the Brits say – but all cabs accept credit and debit cards (with no extra charge) via contactless payment devices. (There are some extra charges, such as on certain holidays and for trips starting from the taxi ranks at Heathrow.) You can tip as much as you want, but most cab riders tip to the nearest pound. Steer clear of unlicensed cabs, especially ones soliciting you; they're illegal in London and can be dangerous. The ride-hailing app Uber also operates in London.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Tube</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">The London Underground, otherwise known as "the Tube," is simple to use and has extensive routes throughout the city and into neighboring counties. We recommend the pay-as-you-go Oyster card (specifically, a Visitor Oyster Card), which will allow you to travel throughout the Underground's nine zones (though the great majority of tourist attractions are clustered in the first and second zones). Even if you don't plan on using the Tube throughout your entire stay, purchasing an Oyster card (versus a single-fare ticket) will always be cheaper. Plus, a Visitor Oyster card will allow you to take unlimited trips in Zone 1 and Zone 2, and you won't be charged more than 7.40 pounds (or about $10). Remember to touch your Oyster card to the yellow readers as you enter the Tube station and as you exit. Something else to keep in mind: Visitor Oyster cards are not available for purchase in London. You must purchase the card online and have it delivered to your home.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Rail</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Transport for London (TfL) oversees a variety of rail options. London Overground consists of six routes traveling among many parts of the city. TfL Rail ferries riders from Paddington Station in the city to Heathrow Airport and Reading (a commuting town west of London). It also shuttles passengers from Liverpool Street to Shenfield (a town northeast of London). The London Trams network connects travelers to towns south of London, including the famous Wimbledon. It also provides connections to other modes of public transportation. As with the Tube, rail fares vary by time of day and number of zones traversed. The minimum fare is 7.40 pounds (about $10). Also like the Underground, using an Oyster Card rather than a Travelcard (or paper ticket) is considerably cheaper. Trams have the same fares as buses.</p><br>
