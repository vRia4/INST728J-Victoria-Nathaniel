The scope and intricate detail of this momentous renovation is designed to ensure this iconic London establishment is recognized as one of the finest hotels in the world. We look forward to welcoming our guests with kind and intuitive service that is truly British but reflective of our Oriental heritage.” Among all, it is located in one of the most picturesque neighborhoods in the city—Hyde Park—the Mandarin Oriental in London having fantastic place to have as a home base while explore this capital city. Just steps from Buckingham Palace and a stone’s throw from Kensington Palace, the Mandarin is a history lover’s dream.

    <li style="font-size: 20pt; margin-left: 5%; margin-top: 5%;"><strong>Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane</strong></li>
    <img style="width: 55%; margin-left: 10%; margin-top: 3%;" src="image/fourseason.jpg" alt="Four Season Hotels"/>
    
    <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Four Seasons Hotel London At Park Lane is a beautiful property in a modern building. The foyer of the Four Seasons London is decadently attired in black marble and warm burgundy reds. The rooms are exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons and exactly what you’d wish for from a hotel of this caliber. Beautifully finished, perfectly appointed. Your every need is catered for. The decor in the rooms is traditional and classy, with a plush feel. Objet d’art is scattered throughout, with black and white prints of stars from the past hanging from the walls. The decor is a mix of warm golds, browns, and deep reds. The bathrooms are black shiny marble, and luxurious. Even the plush corridors are worth a mention. Adorned with photos of glamorous stars in the vain of Marylin Munroe, they feel safe and luxurious (you need to use your room key to get the lift to take you up to the corridors and rooms). In fact, even though this isn’t a small hotel, the Four Seasons London has the feel of a large boutique hotel with just the right number of rooms and with that “just right” lighting level everywhere – you look fabulous but can still see! Four Seasons Hotel London At Park Lane is a wonderful place to be, whether you are staying or just popping in for a drink at their bar.</h3>
