        Overview ▼
      </div>
      <div class="description">
          <p>If you're dreaming of a remote destination filled with historical charm, pristine beaches, unique wildlife and jaw-dropping mountains, then consider vacationing in Tasmania (or Tassie, as the locals call it). Situated about 150 miles south of Australia's mainland, this island appeals to anyone looking for an adventure. Families will enjoy walking across the suspension bridge at the Launceston Cataract Gorge & First Basin, while adrenaline junkies can hike Wellington Park's Organ Pipes or embark on a multiday trek along Cradle Mountain's Overland Track. Freycinet National Park is an ideal spot for water sports like snorkeling and kayaking, and once the sun goes down, you can get your heart pounding during an evening ghost tour of the Port Arthur Historic Site. In between sightseeing and exploring your surroundings, you'll find a variety of shops and art galleries, as well as eateries that serve fresh seafood and produce alongside locally made wines, beers, ciders and spirits.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Best Months to Visit Tasmania/h2><br>
          
          <p>The best time to visit Tasmania is between December and February, Australia's summer season. Though crowds are at their thickest and room rates at their highest, these months offer the most comfortable temperatures for enjoying the island's abundant outdoor activities. Additionally, summer is filled with food and culture festivals. If you're hoping to hike but want to save some money, consider visiting in late spring (October and November) or early fall (March and April). June, July and August are also months where you're more likely to find accommodation and airfare deals, but you'll want to pack appropriate attire and snow boots to help you cope with the region's chilly temps and ample snow.</p>

          <img style="width: 55%; margin-left: 10%; margin-top: 3%; border-radius: 10px;" src="image/temp.jpg" alt=" Australia weather "/><br>
          
          <h2 style="margin-top: 2%">Culture & Customs</h2><br>
          
          <p>The bulk of Tasmania's art- and culture-focused attractions reside in Hobart, and a variety of music, film and craft events – including the Junction Arts Festival and the Tasmanian Craft Fair – are hosted every year. For an in-depth look at the island's art scene, check out the Tasmanian Arts Guide website.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Safety Procedures</h2><br>
          
          <p>Tasmania is considered a relatively safe place to visit, but you should take precautions when enjoying the island's outdoor activities. Be mindful of any undertows at Tassie beaches. If you find yourself caught in one, swim parallel to land until you're out of the rip current, then swim to shore. You'll also want to travel with a companion and wear insect repellent and adequate boots when hiking. If you're anticipating going on a multiday trek on trails like the Three Capes Track and the Overland Track, Parks & Wildlife Service Tasmania strongly suggests telling someone your plans before you depart. Additionally, you should stay alert while in any part of Australia, since terrorist threats have increased recently. For up-to-date information regarding Australia's current threat level, visit the Australian Government's Australian National Security website. And when visiting larger cities like Hobart, be mindful of your belongings. Foreigners are occasionally targeted by pickpockets and petty thieves in popular tourist areas.</p>

In the northern Cradle Mountain section, you'll find the bulk of the attraction's facilities, including a visitor center, a gift shop and multiple cabins. Cradle Mountain is also the starting point for the Overland Track, a 40-mile path that takes at least six days to complete. The southern Lake St Clair area, meanwhile, features Australia's deepest lake, plus hiking trails and picnic areas. Lake St Clair is also the ending point for the Overland Track. Past visitors said Cradle Mountain - Lake St Clair National Park is "a definite must when visiting Tasmania." On top of jaw-dropping forest and mountain scenery, you may see wild critters like wombats, wallabies and platypuses while trekking the park's trails. If you plan on hiking the Overland Track between Oct. 1 and May 31 (peak walking season), remember to make reservations in advance. A trail fee of 160 to 200 Australian dollars (or $126.50 to $158) also applies during these months. The trail fee does not cover park entrance fees.</h3>

      <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Staying in Launceston in northeastern Tasmania? Then you'll want to add the Launceston Cataract Gorge & First Basin to your itinerary. Situated less than 3 miles from downtown Launceston, this natural wonder is brimming with fun pursuits, from hiking trails to a swimming pool to the world's longest single-span chairlift. You'll also find a suspension bridge that links the South Esk River's banks. Must-dos include walking across the suspension bridge, watching the property's resident peacocks, having a picnic lunch and riding the chairlift (for a fee). To make the most of your time here (while saving a little money), some travelers suggest opting for a one-way chairlift ride across the gorge and walking back.</h3>

    <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Buckingham Palace, King Charles III's London home, is open for touring (except for the king's private quarters, of course) from July to October. On the tour, you'll have access to the 19 State Rooms where the king and members of the royal family host guests for state, ceremonial and official affairs. Opulently accented with chandeliers, candelabras, paintings by Van Dyck and Canaletto, and exquisite English and French furniture, these rooms display some of the most magnificent pieces from the Royal Collection.Travelers are welcome to tour the palace during the summer months, when it is open to the public. For the rest of the year, private, guided tours may be available. Visit the palace's website for up-to-date openings and tour times. Ticket prices vary, but you can expect to pay about 30 pounds (about $36) per adult and 16.50 pounds (around $20) per child ages 5 to 17 if you book online before you go. If you're only hoping to quickly pass by this English institution, consider signing up for one of London's best tours – several make stops outside of the palace. If you'd rather skip the admission fees altogether, you can still experience Buckingham Palace by witnessing the storied Changing of the Guard (also referred to as Guard Mounting), which occurs at 11 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesday, Fridays and Sundays most of the year and daily during summer (except during inclement weather). Make sure to get there early, as many previous visitors say the area gets crowded very quickly, making it hard to see anything if you arrive shortly before the ceremony starts. You'll find Buckingham Palace off the Green Park, Hyde Park Corner and St. James's Park Tube stops. Bus Nos. 11, 211, C1 and C10 stop nearby.</h3>

    <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Step through halls where history was made time and again by visiting the British Parliament. Guided and self-guided tours (which come highly recommended by recent travelers) take visitors through multiple areas of the building, including Westminster Hall (the oldest building on the Parliamentary estate, which is more than 900 years old), the House of Commons Chamber and the House of Lords. If you're not interested in perusing the corridors that make up the U.K.'s governing body, many travelers say that simply admiring the iconic structure's impressive exterior is enough, and an absolute must-do for anyone visiting London. Guided and self-guided tours are all available most Saturdays year-round as well as most weekdays during Parliamentary recess. Self-guided tours, which include an audio guide (available in multiple languages), take about 90 minutes and are 25 pounds (about $30) for adults and one child can tour for free with each full-price adult. Otherwise, tickets for a child cost 8 pounds (around $10) for each child aged 5 to 15 years. Guided tours (in English only) cost 32 pounds (around $38) for adults and 16 pounds (about $19) for children ages 5 to 15 years. All children younger than 5 enter for free, but do require a ticket. Consult Parliament's website for up-to-date information on tour dates and hours, as they are subject to change. To get to the Houses of Parliament, hop off at the Westminster Tube station from the Circle, District or Jubilee Underground Lines. Several bus lines stop across the street as well.</h3>

  <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Along with Parliament and Big Ben, Tower Bridge is London's next must-see architectural marvel, not to mention the most famous bridge that crosses the Thames. Construction on the bridge started in 1886, which means it's practically modern by London standards, but Tower Bridge stands out for its stunning detail and moveable roadways that lift up when large ships need to pass through. The views from the bridge are an added bonus. From the elevated sidewalks visitors get a prime view of the Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral's iconic dome, the London Eye and The Monument. If you're interested in viewing the city from a higher vantage point (about 137 feet above the Thames), consider a visit inside Tower Bridge, during which you go to the top of the bridge – equipped with a glass floor – as well as to the bottom to the engine rooms. For self-guided visits, adults pay 12.30 pounds (about $15.50), youths ages 5 to 15 pay 6.30 pounds (about $7.80), while children younger than 5 get in for free. If you have a London Pass, entry to the bridge is included. Guided tours are available on weekends and start at 27 pounds (or about $34). The bridge is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. (with the last entry at 5 p.m.). Keep in mind that a walk across the bridge is free and nearly as impressive. Hop off the Tube at Tower Hill to stroll across. You can also take bus routes nos. 15, 42, 78, 100 and 343. Bike racks and Santander Cycle docking stations are located nearby. For more information, visit the Tower Bridge's website.

The bloke behind the brilliance is none other than Alistair Wise, son of cookbook author Sally Wise, who spent a stint working with Gordon Ramsay. This emporium of happiness—and envy, to be sure—also whips up scrumptious savories including a mean scallop pie and a buttery poached chicken “sanger” with bacon, lettuce, hummus, mayo, and hard-boiled egg. </h3>

    <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">A tiny northern Hobart restaurant with brick walls and no more than 20 seats joined the city’s dining scene in 2017, quickly winning over locals with its reinvented riffs on Italian classics. Chef Matt Breen’s Aussie-Italian ethos was partially honed at Smolt, where he worked in Salamanca Square for several years. At Templo, Breen’s blackboard menu features around 10 dishes; two of them are often broccolini-chili gnocchetti and beef carpaccio with radicchio and anchovy cream. If you can’t decide, order the chef’s menu for $60 and try every plate except dessert. It’s all meant to be shared, just like a nice bottle of red (there’s a solid list of Australian and Italian vintages, or you can BYO for a $15 corkage fee).</h3>

  <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Owned by the Franklin restaurant team, Peppermint Bay Hotel in Woodbridge is a destination restaurant not only for its modern Aussie fare cooked up with farm-fresh produce (a lot of it grown on-site). It’s also beloved for its panoramic views of the D’Entrecasteaux Channel and regular concerts featuring the likes of Justin Townes Earle and Marlon Williams, which travelers can sail to on a Peppermint Bay cruise from Sullivans Cove in Hobart. While you’re in Woodbridge, pop by the tasting room at Woodbridge Smokehouse to sample ocean trout and Atlantic salmon smoked over a variety of hardwoods including shavings from the surrounding apple orchard.</h3>

Edible flowers and bright sauce droplets create art on the plate. But the real masterpieces are the desserts. If “chess mate” and “lemon basil legos” are on the menu, order both.

  <div class="description">
    <p class="text">The best way to get around Tasmania is by car. Though you'll have to get used to different driving norms, such as traveling on the left side of the road and calculating distances in kilometers, hiring a car is an affordable and convenient way to see many Tassie cities and sights. Organized bus tours from local companies are also available but are often more expensive and require sticking to set itineraries. Within major cities like Hobart and Launceston, public and private bus services are also an option. Keep in mind that bus operators vary by destination, and routes between cities are generally limited. Additionally, you can hail a taxi, but cab fares are high and are dependent on the location and time of day.</a></p><br>
          
    <h2>Car</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Getting around Tasmania with a car is fairly straightforward thanks to the island's compact size and well-maintained roads, which are generally uncrowded. Plus, road signs are in English, and Americans only need a valid U.S. driver's license to drive in Australia. But remember, some Tasmanian customs are different than those found in the U.S. Locals drive on the left side of the road, gas is sold by the liter – most gas stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily – and distances are measured in kilometers. You should also take extra precautions when driving on ice- or snow-covered roads and keep an eye out for wild animals, especially when driving early in the morning or as the sun sets. For a list of self-drive itineraries, visit Discover Tasmania's website.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Tour Bus</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">If you don't mind paying a little more to avoid driving, consider joining an organized bus tour. Offered by companies like APT and AAT Kings, these multiday excursions are typically four to 14 days and include visits to must-see sights like the Port Arthur Historic Site, the Launceston Cataract Gorge & First Basin and Freycinet National Park, plus most meals, bus transfers and accommodations at area hotels or on a catamaran. Itineraries, however, cannot be customized, and you'll pay approximately $1,645 to $4,595 per person.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Bus</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Although traveling by bus within a city can be a cost-effective and easy way to get around, public transportation is limited between cities, and bus operators vary by destination. In Hobart, Burnie and Launceston, the cities with the largest bus networks, most buses are operated by Metro. Fares are calculated by zone and payment method. Rides in downtown areas cost 3.30 Australian dollars (less than $3) for adults and AU$1.70 (about $1) for children ages 5 to 15 when paid with cash; if you purchase a preloaded Greencard from select locales in Hobart, fares are AU$2.64 ($2) per adult. Kids Greencards are not sold in any retail stores. Bus schedules and routes differ by city, but maps and timetables can be found on Metro's website.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Taxi</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Taxis can be hailed by phone or on the street throughout Tasmania, but prices are high and vary by location and time of day. Rates are most expensive on weekends, public holidays and between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. on weekdays. On King Island and Flinders Island, meters start at AU$5.10 ($4) and increase by AU$2.17 or AU$2.60 for each kilometer traveled (or between $2.50 and $3.50 per mile). For all other areas, rides cost AU$3.60 (less than $3), plus AU$1.91 to AU$2.32 per kilometer traveled (or $2.50 to $3 per mile). Fees are higher when at least one passenger is using a wheelchair. Additional charges may also apply for late-night trips that originate outside major cities, paying with a credit card and starting your journey at an airport. Tipping is not expected when using taxis in Tasmania or other parts of Australia, but Aussies generally round up to the nearest Australian dollar. In Hobart and its suburbs, you can also use the Uber ride-hailing service to get around.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Plane</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">After arriving in Tasmania, you can fly between various Tassie destinations. Hobart is where the island's international airport is located, but regional airports are also available in cities like Burnie and Launceston. Two domestic airlines operate in Tasmania: Sharp Airlines and Par Avion Airlines. Sharp Airlines offers daily flights between destinations like King Island and Burnie, and Flinders Island and Launceston, while Par Avion Airlines operates between Hobart and Burnie three days per week. Flight prices depend on the route and dates booked but start at AU$125 (or $99) per person.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Ferry</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">To get to Tasmania from mainland Australia, you can take a Spirit of Tasmania ferry from Melbourne to Devonport. Most ferries depart at 7:30 p.m. daily, but select days have sailings at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Each trip lasts about 10 ½ hours. Ferry tickets cost AU$79 to AU$160 (or $62.50 to $126.50) per adult and AU$29 to AU$60 (about $23 to $47.50) for every child between 3 and 15. For travelers interested in getting to smaller Tassie islands like Bruny Island and Maria Island, ferry services are offered by Bruny Island Ferry and Encounter Maria Island. Bruny Island Ferry's boats travel between Kettering and Bruny Island from 6:30 or 7:30 a.m. to 7:15 p.m. daily and are free for pedestrians. Encounter Maria Island's ferries travel between Triabunna and Maria Island, but schedules vary by season. In May, June, July and August, ferries operate every day except Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.; from September to April, ferries are available daily between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. All tickets, which cost AU$50 ($39.50) for adults and AU$33 ($26) for kids ages 4 to 16, are for round-trip rides and include Maria Island National Park admissions. Ferry service on Lake St Clair between Cynthia Bay and Narcissus Hut, where the Overland Track ends, is also provided year-round by Lake St Clair Lodge. One-way fares are AU$40 (less than $32) per adult and AU$20 (approximately $16) for each child 11 and younger.</p><br>
