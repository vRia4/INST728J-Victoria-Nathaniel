        Overview ▼
      </div>
      <div class="description">
          <p>Life in London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers find that one visit isn't enough to experience everything this two-millennia-old city has to offer. Here, the antiquated clasps hands with the contemporary. You'll find the historic Tower of London and the avant-garde Tate Modern. You can catch both the Bard's works and modern plays at Shakespeare's Globe and its accompanying Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. And while Londoners still praise the power of tea, they now make room for Starbucks and Costa Coffees here and there, and pressed juice too. A current leader in everything from politics and banking to fashion and music, London's culture compass is always attuned to what's next. Discover it all on one of London's best tours. One thing to keep in mind it's nearly impossible to escape crowds in London. Along with being one of the biggest cities in Europe, London is one of the most popular destinations to visit in the world, so no matter what time of year you go, you're bound to run into lots of tourists. A valid passport is required for U.S. citizens entering the United Kingdom. No tourist visas are required for visits less than six months. If you're planning to travel to other continental European countries, it is recommended that you have six months remaining validity on your passport. For more information, visit the U.S. State Department's website.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Best Months to Visit London</h2><br>
          
          <p>The best time to visit London is March through May when the temperatures are mild and the city's parks are green and blooming. However, late spring – along with summer – is also prime tourist season, and hotel and flight prices reflect the surge. You're more likely to find airfare and accommodation deals in the fall and winter though you'll also encounter chilly temperatures. December in London is also an incredibly popular place to be during the holidays, so expect the streets to be crowded with both English and international tourists. And no matter when you travel, you should pack an umbrella: London is notorious for experiencing misty days and showers year-round. If you have any concerns related to the weather, crowds or other unpredictable factors, you might want to consider an international travel insurance policy or a cancel for any reason plan for more extensive coverage.</p>

          <img style="width: 55%; margin-left: 10%; margin-top: 3%; border-radius: 10px;" src="image/lontemp.jpg" alt=" London weather "/><br>
          
          <h2 style="margin-top: 2%">Culture & Customs</h2><br>
          
          <p>Aside from a few select phrases and words, Americans find the city accessible because of London's official English language. British people are very polite and quite friendly to tourists, so don't be afraid to ask for directions if you're lost. More often than not Londoners are happy to point you in the right direction, or even offer a recommendation about their city. But keep in mind that the British like order. There is no better example than how you are expected to behave on the Tube (London's subway). Make sure to stand to the right when going up or down escalators. The other side to the Brits, especially among the young adults, is their penchant for drinking. Unlike coffee shops in the U.S., pubs are the prime watering hole for the Brits. Most pubs serve meals and are open the majority of the day, so don't be alarmed if you see people walking in with young children. Once 5 o'clock rolls around, the hunger for a post-work pick me up is rampant in London, and pubs, as well as bars, tend to fill up throughout the week. Expect to see hordes of people congregating outside pubs in the warmer months and some stumbling out nightly at around 9 p.m. Also, since London is one of the fashion capitals of the world, you'll see locals dressed to the nines throughout the city but especially around Oxford Street, where many fashion houses and publications are located. If you ever wanted to go the extra mile with your style game, London is the place to do it.London's official currency is the British pound. Since the pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. As for tipping, some restaurants and cafes may add a service charge to the bill, upward of 12%. If a service charge is not allotted, it's customary to tip between 10 and 15%, especially if you're in a restaurant. If you're drinking at a pub or wine bar, tipping is discretionary. And in a cab, tip the driver to the nearest pound or about 10% of the cost. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Safety Procedures</h2><br>
          
          <p>London is generally a very safe city; however, travelers should take note of several safety tips. The U.S. State Department advises tourists to only use London's licensed black cabs. Unlicensed cab companies and private cars posing as taxis have been known to rip off, mug, or even sexually assault customers. To be safe, travelers should call the taxi company and hire a car directly (hotels can help arrange transportation as well). Travelers should also be wary of pickpockets, who tend to target tourists on the Tube or at popular attractions. The U.S. State Department also strongly advises visitors not to leave drinks unattended in bars and nightclubs, as there have been reports of robbery and rape after drinks have been spiked with illegal substances. For more information, visit the state department's <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(53, 1, 1);" href='https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/UnitedKingdom.html'>website.</a> In recent years, London has also been the target of several terrorist attacks, five of which occurred in 2017 alone. According to the U.S. Department of State, terrorist groups continue to plot attacks, so increased vigilance is required. Travelers should stay aware of their surroundings, consider enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive security messages and follow local media to stay informed.  </p>

          <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">The Savoy is a five-star experience known worldwide for its luxurious and beautiful accommodations. As the first hotel built for the purpose of being a luxe hotel in all of London, it has a rich and storied history. Of all the hotels in London, this is one of the most iconic. The rumored favorite hotel of Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich (who has a suite named after her), the Savoy was the first hotel in Britain to have elevators and electric light, and it is still at the top of its game. There’s a guaranteed shiver of excitement as you step past the top hats and tails of the doormen and back in time onto the checkered floor of the grand, wood-paneled lobby. Seeing its beautiful architecture and dramatic decor is worth doing even if you don't end up staying here.</h3>

Enjoy contemporary afternoon tea modeled after the art of British sculptor Antony Gormley in the intimate Mirror Room, then step out into the bustling heart of London.

Also nearby is Borough Market, a popular food market, and slightly further you have St Paul’s Cathedral, Millennium Bridge, Shakespeare’s Globe and Tate Modern.

We look forward to welcoming our guests with kind and intuitive service that is truly British but reflective of our Oriental heritage.” Among all, it is located in one of the most picturesque neighborhoods in the city—Hyde Park—the Mandarin Oriental in London having fantastic place to have as a home base while explore this capital city. Just steps from Buckingham Palace and a stone’s throw from Kensington Palace, the Mandarin is a history lover’s dream.

The foyer of the Four Seasons London is decadently attired in black marble and warm burgundy reds. The rooms are exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons and exactly what you’d wish for from a hotel of this caliber. Beautifully finished, perfectly appointed. Your every need is catered for. The decor in the rooms is traditional and classy, with a plush feel. Objet d’art is scattered throughout, with black and white prints of stars from the past hanging from the walls. The decor is a mix of warm golds, browns, and deep reds. The bathrooms are black shiny marble, and luxurious. Even the plush corridors are worth a mention. Adorned with photos of glamorous stars in the vain of Marylin Munroe, they feel safe and luxurious (you need to use your room key to get the lift to take you up to the corridors and rooms). In fact, even though this isn’t a small hotel, the Four Seasons London has the feel of a large boutique hotel with just the right number of rooms and with that “just right” lighting level everywhere – you look fabulous but can still see! Four Seasons Hotel London At Park Lane is a wonderful place to be, whether you are staying or just popping in for a drink at their bar.</h3>

        <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">The British Museum is both an architectural beauty and a trove of some of the world's most noted antiquities. In fact, many travelers say it's the best museum in all of London. What's more, it's free to visit. From the Rosetta Stone to the Parthenon Sculptures to Mesopotamian objects, the British Museum is a history buff's dream containing artifacts in the millions. The immense collection can make an initial museum visit seem overwhelming: Pick the exhibits that most interest you, and plan return trips if you feel so inclined. The museum opens daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and closes at 8:30 p.m. on Fridays. Though admission is free, access to some exhibitions will cost you. While walk-up entry is available, the museum recommends booking tickets online in advance. You'll find a gift shop and four eateries on-site, including two quick-service cafes and casual pizzeria, as well as the more formal Great Court Restaurant. In addition, food trucks serve those opting to eat outside. The British Museum is accessible from the Tottenham Court Road, Holborn, Goodge Street and Russell Square Tube stops. More than a dozen bus routes also stop near the museum. For more information, visit the British Museum's website.</h3>

    <p>The best way to get around London is the rapid-transit London Underground, or what locals call "the Tube." You can even take the Tube from <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(53, 1, 1);" href='https://www.heathrow.com/'>Heathrow Airport</a> (LHR) – one of the world's busiest airports – into the city center. This widespread and efficient system stretches throughout London and beyond, and it is relatively easy to navigate. Buying an Oyster card will further simplify your travel since it can be used on the Underground system, as well as on city buses and other forms of transportation. Visitors should also bring a comfortable pair of walking shoes since meandering is the most atmospheric way to traverse the city. If you need a little guidance on where to wander, consult a local by taking one of <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(53, 1, 1);" href='https://travel.usnews.com/features/the-best-london-tours'>London's top tours</a>.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Bicycle</h2><br>
    
    <p>London's bike-sharing operation, Santander Cycle, facilitates unlimited trips of up to 30 minutes within a 24-hour period for just 2 pounds (about $2.75). (Trips longer than half an hour result in charges of 2 pounds per each 30-minute interval.) The system has 11,500 bikes and more than 750 docking stations around London. You can hire a bike with a credit card at a docking station or using the app available from Transport for London.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Bus</h2><br>
    
    <p>The allure to traveling by bus is that you get to see the sights. The London Underground is, well, underground, so you miss out on the city's scenic views. Fares start at 1.55 pounds (about $2.15) for a single ride with an Oyster. Keep in mind that buses don't take cash, so it's best to have a topped-up Oyster card to pay for your trip. Many bus routes cover the entire city and run 24 hours a day. According to the London visitor's bureau, routes Nos. 9, 14, 15 and 22 are particularly good for sightseeing.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Car</h2><br>
    
    <p>Think twice before "hiring" or renting a car in London. For Americans used to driving on the right side of the road, keep in mind that Londoners drive on the left. The cars are also usually manual; automatics tend to cost more. In addition, traffic and parking are awful, and the cost of petrol (or gas) is high. That said, you can hire cars at the airports or at many locations throughout central London. Keep in mind that using hand-held cell phones while driving is illegal; the speed limit on highways is 70 mph.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Taxi</h2><br>
    
    <p>London's famous black cabs can be found throughout the city, as well as in designated lines at busy train stations, airports and hotels. When you're hailing one on the street, keep in mind that a lit-up taxi sign means it's available. Cabs are metered, and fares vary by time of day and distance. There's always a minimum fee of 3.20 pounds (about $4.40), but a journey of a mile or more will cost at least 6.20 pounds (about $8.50). You can pay with cash – or quid, as the Brits say – but all cabs accept credit and debit cards (with no extra charge) via contactless payment devices. (There are some extra charges, such as on certain holidays and for trips starting from the taxi ranks at Heathrow.) You can tip as much as you want, but most cab riders tip to the nearest pound. Steer clear of unlicensed cabs, especially ones soliciting you; they're illegal in London and can be dangerous. The ride-hailing app Uber also operates in London.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Tube</h2><br>
    
    <p>The London Underground, otherwise known as "the Tube," is simple to use and has extensive routes throughout the city and into neighboring counties. We recommend the pay-as-you-go Oyster card (specifically, a Visitor Oyster Card), which will allow you to travel throughout the Underground's nine zones (though the great majority of tourist attractions are clustered in the first and second zones). Even if you don't plan on using the Tube throughout your entire stay, purchasing an Oyster card (versus a single-fare ticket) will always be cheaper. Plus, a Visitor Oyster card will allow you to take unlimited trips in Zone 1 and Zone 2, and you won't be charged more than 7.40 pounds (or about $10). Remember to touch your Oyster card to the yellow readers as you enter the Tube station and as you exit. Something else to keep in mind: Visitor Oyster cards are not available for purchase in London. You must purchase the card online and have it delivered to your home.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Rail</h2><br>
    
    <p>Transport for London (TfL) oversees a variety of rail options. London Overground consists of six routes traveling among many parts of the city. TfL Rail ferries riders from Paddington Station in the city to Heathrow Airport and Reading (a commuting town west of London). It also shuttles passengers from Liverpool Street to Shenfield (a town northeast of London). The London Trams network connects travelers to towns south of London, including the famous Wimbledon. It also provides connections to other modes of public transportation. As with the Tube, rail fares vary by time of day and number of zones traversed. The minimum fare is 7.40 pounds (about $10). Also like the Underground, using an Oyster Card rather than a Travelcard (or paper ticket) is considerably cheaper. Trams have the same fares as buses.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Bicycle</h2><br>
    
    <p>London's bike-sharing operation, Santander Cycle, facilitates unlimited trips of up to 30 minutes within a 24-hour period for just 2 pounds (about $2.75). (Trips longer than half an hour result in charges of 2 pounds per each 30-minute interval.) The system has 11,500 bikes and more than 750 docking stations around London. You can hire a bike with a credit card at a docking station or using the app available from Transport for London.</p>
