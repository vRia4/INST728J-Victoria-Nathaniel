        Overview ▼
      </div>
      <div class="description">
          <p>Take a number of diverse cultures, add a strong dose of the arts and a splash of ocean water, and you have Miami. Looking at the fantastic art museums and the blossoming gastronomical scene, you might find it hard to believe that just a century ago, this colorful Floridian city was covered in swampland. Once developers rushed into the area, one of the most popular tourist destinations and spectacular city skylines in the country was born. Today, with South Beach before you and the Everglades behind you, you can walk through the bustling streets past historical homes with Spanish words and Caribbean music floating into your ears. This mini melting pot has preserved multicultural neighborhoods like famous Little Havana as enclaves for unique traditions to thrive. United, they form an electric network – Miami. Its reputation for vibrant nightlife and extravagant parties is realized in Miami Beach, a barrier island to the east of the mainland. Meanwhile, the down-to-earth city proper cultivates an artsy vibe. For a taste of Miami Beach, sign up for one of the city's best boat tours, where you'll be able to marvel at the glitzy skyline from the water on a boat tour or via parasail.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Best Months to Visit Miami</h2><br>
          
          <p>The best time to visit Miami is between March and May. During these months, you'll be able to enjoy daily temperatures in the 70s for non-peak rates, while the rest of the country is still defrosting. The year-round tropical climate and partying ways of nearby Miami Beach mean tourists – lots of tourists – from northern states, South America, Europe, Asia, anywhere and everywhere year-round. And when there are special events, the city sees even more visitors and higher hotel rates. For the best chance of scoring deals, book around the city-wide events or during the sweltering summer months.</p>

          <img style="width: 55%; margin-left: 10%; margin-top: 3%; border-radius: 10px;" src="image/lontemp.jpg" alt=" Miami weather "/><br>
          
          <h2 style="margin-top: 2%">Culture & Customs</h2><br>
          
          <p>As a favorite getaway spot for celebrities and the well-to-do, Miami's atmosphere is slightly more posh than some of the smaller coastal cities, such as Destin or Fort Lauderdale. Visitors should be prepared to look their best, especially when dining out or partaking in the nightlife in nearby Miami Beach. But there's another side of this town that is heavily influenced by Latin culture. A large portion of the city's population is made up of people from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Haiti. Because of this influx of immigrants, Spanish is widely spoken here – particularly in neighborhoods like Little Havana – and you might hear a bit of French Creole as well. Latin culture has also had a big influence on Miami's nightlife scene, with many establishments featuring Latin music and dance. With its mix of cultures and larger than life persona, it's no wonder that there's also a vibrant art scene in the greater Miami area. From multiple art museums that fit every taste to numerous galleries of contemporary and modern art, there is no shortage of creativity in this city. People flock to the city in December for the popular Art Basel show.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Safety Procedures</h2><br>
          
          <p>Miami is a big city, so it's best to keep safety in mind at all times, even when you're in your hotel. Always carry a map (or have one downloaded on your phone) and stay away from unfamiliar areas at night. As in any large city, keep an eye on your personal items at all times, especially if you're out on the town. Do not carry wallets in back pockets and keep a firm grasp on any purses or bags you may have with you. Like in most major cities, Miami does feature a few transients who generally panhandle in the more touristy parts of town. Some experts recommend avoiding the downtown area at night. While it's a bustling part of town during the day, it empties out after hours and can get somewhat seedy. Miami weather can also be cause for concern. Keep an eye on the forecast for hurricane or tropical storm warnings. If you do happen to experience a hurricane, stay indoors and listen to the radio or television for up-to-date emergency information. After the storm has passed, avoid downed power lines and flooded streets. Experts also advise caution when walking around, since debris such as broken glass can be hard to spot.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Recent lodgers said their stays at the Faena Hotel Miami Beach were next to perfect. Past guests gushed about the staff's attention to detail and genuine friendliness. Accommodations received tons of praise as well, and were described by reviewers as spacious (the smallest rooms measure 463 square feet), well appointed and downright chic. Rooms are decorated in a modern, South American style and come outfitted with sleek wooden furnishings and colorful accents. Other amenities include flat-screen TVs, Wi-Fi access (which is covered by the daily resort fee) and marble bathrooms with walk-in showers. Some standard rooms are also equipped with furnished balconies, and most rooms offer ocean views. What's more, lodgers in select suites will have access to a Faena Butler to arrange any request. Dining here is also a big attraction. Travelers say you can't leave without grabbing a bite at Pao by Paul Qui (just make sure to reserve a table in advance). The hotel's other dining venues include Los Fuegos By Francis Mallmann, which specializes in South American grilling, El Secreto Omakase by Paul Qui, which serves seafood, and Gitano Miami at Casa Faena, a posh Mexican eatery with inventive cocktails. There is also a selection of bars and lounges with live DJs. Additionally, the Faena boasts an Old Hollywood-style theater that hosts cabaret shows, as well as the Tierra Santa Healing House spa. You can find this highly acclaimed hotel in the heart of Miami Beach, Florida. But be forewarned: Guests say a stay here is pricey.</h3>

        <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">The Ritz-Carlton South Beach, one of a string of hotels on Miami’s destination waterfront, is a refined respite from the area’s pool parties and ‘til-the-sun-rises nightlife, while still providing easy access to the city’s best restaurants, a great lobby bar scene, and ocean views. The rooms are crisp and modern, with white walls and linens punctuated by deep cerulean blue furniture—a velvet bed frame, plush chaise—and mid-century-style accents like bronze reading lamps and caned armchairs. In the ocean-view rooms and suites, which make up a majority of the room categories, the brilliant Atlantic out of the window is the real star of the show, just as it should be. Like most Ritz-Carltons, the experience is reliably five-star: service is fantastic, the decor is elevated and modern while nodding to the destination, amenities leave little to be desired, and the location is ideal.</h3>

      <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Any day you arrive at a hotel by boat is a good day, and the palms and lawns of The Fisher Island Club come into view as the ferry from Miami cruises ashore. With bright-orange terracotta roofs, the cluster of white cottages look like an island village, the larger buildings and villas peeping out from behind them. The resort was built around an original 1920s-era mansion, once the winter estate of William K. Vanderbilt.</h3>

      <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Even amid the architectural exhibitionism of Miami Beach, the gleaming curved main tower of the 1,500-room Fontainebleau Miami Beach is a knockout. The design of this essentially launched the so-called Miami-Modern style, and the resort dominates its stretch of Miami Beach. It’s a clean and classic escape where contemporary vibes meets retro in a flash of glamour. Although the Fontainebleau has been upgraded at no small expense, guests still feel like they’re part of its storied past.</h3>

Collins Avenue Shopping Area and Miami Beach Boardwalk are worth checking out if shopping is on the agenda, while those wishing to experience the area's natural beauty can explore Ocean Drive. Looking to enjoy an event or a game? See what's going on at Miami Beach Convention Center or Kaseya Center. Scuba diving, sailing, and surfing/body boarding offer great chances to get out on the surrounding water, or you can seek out an adventure with ecotours nearby.</h3>

        <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">There's something for everyone in Miami Beach – and a lot of it. White sand, an eclectic dining scene, prime shopping, luxurious spas and world-class nightlife are all staples in Miami Beach. Just make sure to bring plenty of cash – Miami Beach can be done on a budget, but you'll severely limit your options and it won't be nearly as fun. Travelers go to Miami mainly for Miami Beach and they go to Miami Beach mainly for South Beach, the region's unrivaled crown jewel, which visitors say they can't get enough of. Here, the art deco history of the city meets the bright lights and vibrant nightlife of the younger generation. There are several ways to get to Miami Beach from downtown Miami, including the Metrobus and taxi. Many travelers prefer to simplify things by basing their vacation in one of the many hotels here. South Beach has the costliest accommodations – thriftier travelers can find a deal if they stay farther north, between 24th and 192nd Streets.</h3>

      <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">South Beach is the iconic neighborhood of 9-mile Miami Beach. Whether you love it for the art deco buildings, sunshine, or its numerous film and television appearances ("The Birdcage" and "Bad Boys" are just a few set here), it is worth a visit. Lincoln Road is bursting with stores (both national brands and boutiques), bars, restaurants and endless people-watching opportunities. The Wolfsonian-FIU museum and several parks offer alternatives to South Beach's most popular pastime: beach-going. Lounge, walk, or bike along the water with local and tourists alike. Lummus Park separates some of the beach from the city streets. It houses sports courts, restrooms, walking paths, gyms and playgrounds. South Beach is located across Biscayne Bay from downtown. It is approximately one-third of Miami Beach, comprising the entire portion south of Dade Boulevard. Those looking for public transit from downtown can hop on the S or No. 120 bus routes.</h3>

    <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">In a city of skyscrapers, Bayfront Park provides a welcome green space in downtown Miami. What's more, the park boasts a waterfront location on Biscayne Bay. Over the past century, the city expanded 32-acre Bayfront Park's offerings to meet the requests of Miamians. Nowadays, the park hosts many events, such as yoga, movie nights and salsa classes, all of which are free. Bayfront Park also hosts a handful of paid events, such as festivals and concerts. The park's amphitheater and pavilion impress visitors, especially because these venues host concerts and yoga classes, respectively. Parkgoers also enjoy the panoramic views of the bay. Many suggested walking here before or after a visit to Bayside Marketplace. The park sits in downtown Miami, just north of the InterContinental Miami. The Metromover includes a stop at the southwest corner of the park, which is aptly named Bayfront Park Station. Travelers must purchase tickets for paid events from the events' respective websites.</h3>

    <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">The Art Deco Historic District includes more than 800 buildings in the vibrant art deco style, primarily 1920s and 1930s designs. Many of these buildings are protected by local preservation ordinance – an effort spearheaded by Barbara Capitman nearly 50 years ago. Hotels, fountains and other structures provide a colorful and fun backdrop for vacation photos. For those interested in the history of the historic district, take one of the Miami Design Preservation League's tours. Visitors love walking the Art Deco Historic District. Many recommend taking in the neighborhood at night, when the lights add to the already colorful surroundings. Visitors note that having a drink or meal here will be expensive, but may be worth the splurge. The Art Deco Historic District is concentrated in Miami Beach's South Beach. There is street and paid parking available, or you can take the No. 120 bus from downtown Miami. Note that parking near South Beach can be difficult and expensive; if you are not staying in walking distance, a bus or ride-share may simplify your trip.</h3>

  <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens were originally built as a winter villa for businessman James Deering in the early 1900s. Today, it serves as a museum, with a wide variety of art from the 15th to the 19th century. The atmosphere and architecture are a key part of the experience, which impress visitors. Much of the original house (which spans 38,000 feet) is intact and showcases a neat assortment of vintage furniture. For many travelers, the gorgeous gardens are the highlight of a trip here. Plus, the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens is one of the top musuems in Miami. Visitors say the picturesque grounds remind them of European mansions. You can walk around the property at your leisure. The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens are located 2 miles southwest of Brickell City Centre. Public transport is available with easy access from the Vizcaya Metrorail station, but there's also free parking should you choose to drive. Admission costs $25 for adults and $10 for children ages 6 through 12. During peak season from February to March, adult tickets are $29. The museum is open Wednesday through Monday from 9:30 a.m. and the last admission is at 4:30 p.m.</h3>

      <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Dilara is a low-key looking joint on Finsbury Park’s Blackstock Road that serves huge, incredible helpings of Uyghur cuisine, a blend of northern Chinese dishes like noodles and dumplings, kebabs and meat-soaked bread. It’s one of the few places in London where you can find overlooked, but certainly not under-flavoured Uyghur food (Etles in Walthamstow is another). Come for a powerful Szechuan punch and some of the finest noodles in London. Most common dishes people order are large-plate chicken, with its hand-pulled noodles and dry chill spice, tugure dumplings, samsa pastries and smashed cucumber on the side. </h3>

Massive portions with a side order of massive fun. What’s not to like? It’s cheaper than booking a flight to Thailand by way of California, and because it’s in a hotel, it’s open all day for indulgent brekkies and lunches, too. Most popular dish: The gloriously gloopy blue-cheese-slathered wedge salad, complete with candied pork jowl and garlic nam jim dipping sauce. Add on a fried chicken khao soi: perfect katsu-style chicken plonked on a bed of creamy Chiang Mai curried noodles with bean sprouts and roasted chilli oil.</h3>

  <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">The menu itself is befitting of such a grand Victorian building. Rather than match the art with aggressively modern cuisine, the food here is traditional British fare with a touch of contemporary grace. This Mayfair newbie opened at the end of 2022 and, thanks to owners Hauser & Wirth, contains £50m-worth of masterpieces by everyone from Lucian Freud to Pablo Picasso. The food – trad British which borders on the Victorian but comes with a graceful twist – is pretty special too. Most popular dish: The showstopping lobster-head pie has got everyone talking, and at £96 you’d hope it would. But it’s possible to plump for something a little more pocket-friendly, including a selection of classic savouries, such as London rarebit, Gentleman’s Relish and cucumber on toast, or devilled-kidney omelette at £12 each.</h3>

  <h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Step through halls where history was made time and again by visiting the British Parliament. Guided and self-guided tours (which come highly recommended by recent travelers) take visitors through multiple areas of the building, including Westminster Hall (the oldest building on the Parliamentary estate, which is more than 900 years old), the House of Commons Chamber and the House of Lords. If you're not interested in perusing the corridors that make up the U.K.'s governing body, many travelers say that simply admiring the iconic structure's impressive exterior is enough, and an absolute must-do for anyone visiting London. Guided and self-guided tours are all available most Saturdays year-round as well as most weekdays during Parliamentary recess. Self-guided tours, which include an audio guide (available in multiple languages), take about 90 minutes and are 25 pounds (about $30) for adults and one child can tour for free with each full-price adult. Otherwise, tickets for a child cost 8 pounds (around $10) for each child aged 5 to 15 years. Guided tours (in English only) cost 32 pounds (around $38) for adults and 16 pounds (about $19) for children ages 5 to 15 years. All children younger than 5 enter for free, but do require a ticket. Consult Parliament's website for up-to-date information on tour dates and hours, as they are subject to change. To get to the Houses of Parliament, hop off at the Westminster Tube station from the Circle, District or Jubilee Underground Lines. Several bus lines stop across the street as well.</h3>

<h3 style="width: 50%; text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%; margin-top: 2%;">Along with Parliament and Big Ben, Tower Bridge is London's next must-see architectural marvel, not to mention the most famous bridge that crosses the Thames. Construction on the bridge started in 1886, which means it's practically modern by London standards, but Tower Bridge stands out for its stunning detail and moveable roadways that lift up when large ships need to pass through. The views from the bridge are an added bonus. From the elevated sidewalks visitors get a prime view of the Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral's iconic dome, the London Eye and The Monument. If you're interested in viewing the city from a higher vantage point (about 137 feet above the Thames), consider a visit inside Tower Bridge, during which you go to the top of the bridge – equipped with a glass floor – as well as to the bottom to the engine rooms. For self-guided visits, adults pay 12.30 pounds (about $15.50), youths ages 5 to 15 pay 6.30 pounds (about $7.80), while children younger than 5 get in for free. If you have a London Pass, entry to the bridge is included. Guided tours are available on weekends and start at 27 pounds (or about $34). The bridge is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. (with the last entry at 5 p.m.). Keep in mind that a walk across the bridge is free and nearly as impressive. Hop off the Tube at Tower Hill to stroll across. You can also take bus routes nos. 15, 42, 78, 100 and 343. Bike racks and Santander Cycle docking stations are located nearby. For more information, visit the Tower Bridge's website.

  <div class="description">
    <p class="text">The best way to get around Miami is by car. Having your own wheels will give you the freedom to roam the streets and neighborhoods as you please. Note that the roads are on a grid and broken up into quadrants by the east-to-west Flagler Street and north-to-south Miami Avenue. Street numbers increase as you travel farther away. Also, convenient parking is the norm here. Taxis or ride-hailing services are another option; however, your wallet won't thank you for hailing them so often. The mammoth Miami International Airport (MIA) hosts a fleet of rental car agencies. Several free public transportation options are also available, including the trolley and Metromover. These can be viable options if you're planning to base yourself downtown. And as with most big cities, bike-share and scooter programs are another option for exploring short distances. When flying into south Florida (which includes West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Greater Miami), you have several options. The Miami airport is the largest and right next to downtown, but some tourists prefer flying into the less-hectic Fort Lauderdale International Airport (FLL), renting a car and then driving the 25 miles to the city. There are also several regional airports scattered throughout south Florida.</a></p><br>
          
    <h2>Car</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Excluding the city's convoluted downtown, Miami is a very car-friendly place. Attractions, hotels and restaurants are relatively far from each other, making a car the most comfortable, reliable and time-efficient means of getting around. Note that there are toll roads in Miami-Dade County and fees vary. Be on the lookout for aggressive drivers. </p><br>

    <h2>Public Transportation</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">As a tourist, you'll most likely use the trolley more than any other form of public transportation. The air-conditioned trolleys are free to ride and offer looped routes in downtown, Coconut Grove, Wynwood and the Design District, among other hot spots. Trolleys operate Monday through Saturday from approximately 6:30 a.m. to 7, 8 or 11 p.m., depending on the route. Select routes also offer service on Sunday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. There is also a free Miami Beach trolley with four routes that make stops at popular spots like Collins Avenue and Lincoln Road. Other trolleys operating in Coral Gables, Doral and Miami Gardens are also available. Metromover is another free option that offers convenient transportation for visitors exploring downtown and Brickell. Metromover makes stops at Bayfront Park, Maurice A. Ferré Park (home of the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science) and AmericanAirlines Arena, among other locations. Metrorail, a 25-mile elevated rail system, can be of use if you don't want to take a cab from the airport to downtown or south Miami. Fares cost $2.25 per person. You can also transfer to Tri-Rail and Brightline stations using Metrorail. With the ease of the trolley and Metromover, you may find little need to hop on a Metrobus. However, there are a few routes that can prove handy for visitors. Route No. 120 provides easy access to popular stops in Miami Beach, Surfside, Bal Harbour, Aventura Mall and Haulover Park Marina. Route No. 150  offers service between Miami Beach and the airport. Metrobus fares cost $2.25.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Taxi</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Taxis are plentiful in Miami, but if you find yourself away from the main thoroughfare, ride-hailing services like <u>Uber</u> and <u>Lyft</u> are another option. These services can be especially useful after dark, when it's best to avoid walking alone.</p><br>
          
    <h2>Train</h2><br>
    
    <p class="text">Tri-Rail, a commuter train within south Florida, transports passengers to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. This is a great (affordable) way to take a daytrip to one of Miami's neighboring cities. Fares are determined by zones traveled and range from $2.50 to $6.90 for one-way trips. Virgin Trains USA (formally Brightline) is another option. These high-speed trains can connect you with Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and (soon) Orlando. The future Miami to Orlando route promises to get you to Orlando in less than three hours.</p><br>
