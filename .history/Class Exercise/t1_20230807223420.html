        <p>Near the British Museum and Covent Garden, the Rosewood is a centrally located luxury hotel boasting lush, classic decor. The five-star hotel has carefully renovated its Edwardian architecture, melding the historic and modern seamlessly. Enjoy contemporary afternoon tea modeled after the art of British sculptor Antony Gormley in the intimate Mirror Room, then step out into the bustling heart of London. During busy times there is a minimum stay required to book, so be sure to check early and often if you have your heart set on staying at the Rosewood.</p>
